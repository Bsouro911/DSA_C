// 1. Problem Statement: You are tasked with designing a Logistics Tree application for a company that manages the transportation and distribution of goods. The company operates in multiple regions, each with its own set of warehouses and delivery routes. 2. Requirements: a. Region Representation: Implement a tree data structure to represent the hierarchy of regions. Each node represents a region, and child nodes represent sub-regions or warehouses. b. Warehouse Management: Allow the user to add, remove, and update information for warehouses (e.g., name, location, capacity). c. Route Planning: Design an algorithm to find the most efficient delivery route from one warehouse to another within a region. Use appropriate data structures (e.g., graph) to represent routes. d. Inventory Management: Implement operations to add, remove, and update the inventory of goods at each warehouse. e. Goods Transfer: Provide functionality to transfer goods between warehouses, ensuring that the transferred quantity does not exceed the capacity of the receiving warehouse. f. Cost Calculation: Calculate the cost of transporting goods between warehouses, considering factors like distance, mode of transport, and quantity of goods. g. Route Optimization: Optimize routes for multiple deliveries within a region to minimize overall transportation costs and time. h. Reporting and Analytics: Generate reports on inventory levels, transportation costs, and delivery times. Implement basic analytics to identify trends and areas for improvement. i. User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface for interacting with the application, allowing users to perform operations easily.
